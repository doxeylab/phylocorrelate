# phylocorrelate

## Overview

Phylocorrelate is a phylogenetic profiling tool that detects pairs of gene/protein families with similar phylogenetic distributions. Gene co-occurrence is important to detect as it may suggest an interaction between the genes, membership in the same pathway or complex, or more general functional associations or dependencies.

This repo contains source code for building the PhyloCorrelate RShinyApp. It is currently hosted at: [phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca](https://phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca/)

PhyloCorrelate contains pre-computed correlations for 27,372 gene families across 28,315 species, and uses the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) bacterial tree and gene occurrences from [AnnoTree](http://annotree.uwaterloo.ca/) including entries from KEGG, PFAM, and TIGRFAM.


## Dependencies

- `BLAST+`
- `R` version 3.6.x or later

## R package dependencies

### CRAN

`shiny`, `shinyWidgets`, `DT`, `shinycssloaders`, `igraph`, `plotly`, `visNetwork`, `shinythemes`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, `magrittr`, `promises`, `future`, `readr`, `gmailr`, `ps`, `fst`

### BioConductor (version 10 or later)

`topGO`, `S4Vectors`

## Gettings emails from the community message function

Right now the apps send emails automatically whenever someone submits a message using the community feature. To do this, it uses local GMail keys. For obvious reasons, these are not included in the GitHub repo.

## Configuration

Inside the `app` folder is a configuration file, `PhyloCorrConfig.txt`. Editing this can change some of the behaviours of the app. Remember to change the file paths to match your system.

- `URL = "https://phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca/app"`: server app URL
- `IndexURL = "https://phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca"`: server index URL
- `UseBlastp = FALSE`: `TRUE`/`FALSE`; enable/disable BLAST functionality
- `BlastpDB = "/home/$USER/phylocorrelate/blastdb/AllProteomes.faa"`: Location of BLAST database
- `UseGmailBlastp = FALSE`: `TRUE`/`FALSE`; enable/disable the server sending email for BLAST jobs via GMail
- `ServerEmail = "phylocorrelate@gmail.com"`: email to be used by the server to send emails
- `AdminEmail = "phylocorrelate@gmail.com"`: admin email; the server will send emails to this address in case of errors during BLAST analyses
- `GmailCredentials = "/home/$USER/phylocorrelate/app/blastp/credentials.json"`: GMail credentials; look up the [`gmailr`](https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr) package for instructions on how to set this up
- `GmailCache = "/home/$USER/phylocorrelate/app/blastp/.secret"`: GMail cache; look up the [`gmailr`](https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr) R package for instructions on how to set this up
- `BlastpThreads = 2`: number of threads to use when running BLAST

## Generating the necessary data files and BLAST database

**Warning: not recommended unless you have a supercomputer or are willing to wait weeks for the analyses to complete.**

Instructions on how to download and analyse the PFAM/TIGRFAM/KO tables go here.

## Running the app locally

```r
shiny::runApp("app")
```

## Running the app with Shiny Server open source edition

Note: these instructions were written with Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS in mind. They also assume you've created the log folders.

### No SSL

Edit your `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf` (replace `$USER` with your username):

```
run_as shiny;

sanitize_errors false;
preserve_logs true;

server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
      run_as $USER;
      directory_index on;
      app_idle_timeout 0;
      site_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate/index/;
      log_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate-logs/index/;
    }
  location /app {
      run_as $USER;
      app_idle_timeout 0;
      app_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate/app/;
      log_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate-logs/app/;
    }
}
```

If you ever make changes to the app, restart the server:

```
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server
```

### With SSL

If you've installed Shiny Server already, stop it:

```
sudo systemctl stop shiny-server
```

Install `nginx` and stop it:

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

Now edit their configs:

```
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
server {
  listen 80;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca;
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/phylocorrelate.uwaterloo.ca/privkey.pem;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3838;
  }
}
```

Replace `$USER` with the server username:

```
# /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf
run_as shiny;
sanitize_errors false;
preserve_logs true;
server {
  listen 3838 127.0.0.1;
  location / {
    run_as $USER;
    directory_index on;
    app_idle_timeout 0;
    site_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate/index/;
    log_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate-logs/index/;
  }
  location /app-A {
    run_as $USER;
    app_idle_timeout 0;
    app_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate/app/;
    log_dir /home/$USER/phylocorrelate-logs/app/;
  }
}
```

Install `certbot` (based on these [instructions](https://geekflare.com/setup-nginx-with-lets-encrypt-cert/)):

```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
```

Run `certbot`:

```
sudo certbot --nginx
```

It will ask for a domain name. For example, `diffbase.uwaterloo.ca`. Once it's done it will tell you when the certificate will expire. When the time comes, renew it with:

```
sudo certbot renew
```

The `certbot` program will try and automatically modify your `nginx` config file. Make sure it did it correctly.

Start `nginx` and `shiny-server`:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl start shiny-server
```
